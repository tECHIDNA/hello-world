Simple repo for learnin' to GitHub

Hey there.  This is The tECHIDNA, famous in MAME for helping run MAMEtesters back in the day; infamous in MAME for contrib'ing a LOT of cheats for arcade games folks were too squimish to touch (OK, H-Games).

This repo is for me learnin' to GitHub.  I hope to make many useful contribs.

Th-th-that's all folks!
